I'm @SeymourPashayev!

First and foremost, I like to think that I am an <strong>artist</strong>. Whatever I do, I try to make it into my little artwork. If one follows their dream, any work could be artwork. There's always that need for that someone who is so passionate about doing that little thing they do, they become an expert of the levels not seen before - that is art.

I think computer science is an art. I think I am a <strong>computer science artist</strong>. I am, and have been, in love with computers for as long as can remember myself. Computers have always been a huge box of curios. There's so much going on inside them, yet we can interact with them so simply. As the years of my studies went by, I have learned, and am still learning, how unbelievably complex our digital and hardware worlds are. 

Among my interests are Computer Science, Photography and Work with Images, Sound Design and Music Production. I develop software and do cybersecurity research professionally.

- I’m interested in Physics Solvers, Fluid Solverl (SPH), Audio Visualizers, Shaders, Cybersecurity, Audio influencing Video programmatically.
- I’m currently learning a lot of Cybersecurity and Fluid Dynamics in Computation.

I’m looking to collaborate on honestly anything as long as we have patience for each other's stupidity.
